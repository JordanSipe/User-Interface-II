            As you can tell by now, my Name is Jordan Sipe! I am a junior web developer
            and am currently enrolled at Lambda School. I developed a passion for coding
            and web design after using Wix to design my first website for a youth group I ran.
            Every time I created the website I felt as if something was missing, and it was.
            Responsive web design and unique looks have always and will always begin with the basics
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's why I am here. Feel free to take a look below at
            a few of the <span>MANY</span> web designs I have created!

                As you can see in this project, I created a webpage for Sweet Eats Bakery. The pictures
                to the right are samples of the HTML and CSS I used to create the website. In order complete
                the website, I used all my knowledge of web design to create an appealing and highly responsive
                website. To see the website, click <span><a href="https://codepen.io/Jsipe2017/pen/YzNQMxv" target="_blank">HERE</a></span>!
